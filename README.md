# Rutherford Experiment

This code simulates the [Rutherford experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment), which proved that atoms have a relatively small nucleus in which almost all of the mass of the atom is concentrated. The simulation is programmed using the p5, the website itself uses the bootstrap framework for presentation.

## What is the Rutherford experiment and what is it's relevance to physics

The Rutherford experiment (also known as the Geiger-Marsen experiment) is a physics experiment in which helium nuclei were shot at a thin gold film. Most of the helium nuclei, which are positively charged, passes through the film unhindered, but a small fraction of these nuclei bounced back sharply.

This result could be interpreted by modeling the gold atoms in the film (or rather: atoms in general) have almost all their mass concentrated in a positively charged core, around which the much lighter electrons orbit. This model explains the measured nuclei pattern: most of them pass through the empty space between the electrons and the core of the gold atoms, while a small fraction hit one of these cores and were heavily repelled by the electromagnatic interaction with the a core of one of the gold atoms.

This new model for atoms replaced the reighing [plum pudding model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_pudding_model), changing the way science thinks about the physics and chemistry.

## What does the simulation do

At the moment: nothing (yet!). The simulation is in its early stages of development. When a first version of the simulation is ready, a maintained list of active functionalities will be published here.

## Using the simulation

To use the simulation, download or clone the repository and open the `index.html` found in the root directory of the repository.

## Dependencies

The simulation is fully self-contained (i.e. all necessary dependencies are included in the repository), but for reference the complete list of used libraries can be found below.

- p5.js 1.1.9
- Bootstrap 4.5.3 (both javascript and css);
- jQuery 3.5.1;
